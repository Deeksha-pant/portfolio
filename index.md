# Data Science Portfolio

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. 

## Machine Learning

> I am an experienced "traditional" ETL engineer switching to a career as a Machine Learning Engineer.
The pieces of my Machine Learning experiences are scattered, so here is a place that brings them all together in one place.

> Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. —Arthur Samuel, 1959
> Repository containing a portfolio of machine learning projects and weekly progress towards becoming better at Machine Learning algorithms.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.It was required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.A multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
